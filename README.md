# OpenApi Playground

Play with OpenApi, specifically for:

- *legacy* Swagger integration (no longer part of built-in templates)
- New MS-provided components
- Integration with [Minimal APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/overview?view=aspnetcore-8.0)
- Integration with [FastEndpoints](https://fast-endpoints.com/)
- Integration with `Result<>`-based approach, e.g. [Ardalis.Result](https://result.ardalis.com/) or [FluentResults](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FluentResults)
